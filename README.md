### GetItDone

Yeah, there's a million to do list apps on the app store, but you're pretty confident you have a better way "To Do" it.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Create a ‘to do list’ app called GetItDone using Core Data
* The items must at least have a description, optional due date, priority, completion date
* Use a TableView to display the list
* Users should be able to Add or Edit (and save, of course) items from a detail view

OPTIONAL hard mode for this assignment:
Add Categories that the user can maintain and can optionally sort by them in list view
